# Maze Generator
A simple algorithm that generates a maze using the Pixel Game Engine.
This project is a shameless reproduction of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y37-gB83HKE) video by OneLoneCoder.

There really isn't much to say; I simply re-implemented the algorithm as a personal challenge before watching all of the video.
I might come back and improve it with new features such as a different width/height for the maze,
as well as the ability to save the layout to a file for later reuse.

All of the dependencies required to compile the program are specified in both the project file and the Pixel Game Engine header.
They should be fairly self-explanatory, so please refer to those.
